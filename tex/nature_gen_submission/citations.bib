abstract = {With the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace in biology. It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a DNA binding activity detected in nuclear extracts from Hep3B cells cultured in 1{\%} O2 but not in extracts from cells cultured in 20{\%} O2. HIF-1 binds to a sequence within the human erythropoietin gene enhancer that is required for hypoxic activation of transcription. Induction of HIF-1 is inhibited by cycloheximide, which also inhibits induction of erythropoietin RNA. We now demonstrate that induction of both HIF-1 and erythropoietin RNA is inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitor 2-aminopurine. HIF-1 binding to DNA was eliminated by phosphatase treatment of nuclear extracts. Actinomycin D also inhibited HIF-1 induction, suggesting that de novo transcription is required. The kinetics of HIF-1 induction by hypoxia paralleled the kinetics of erythropoietin gene transcriptional induction. HIF-1 DNA binding activity decayed rapidly when hypoxic cells were exposed to increased oxygen tension. In vitro, the kinetics of HIF-1 association with, and dissociation from, its binding site were extremely rapid, with a t1/2 for both processes of {\textless} 1 min. These findings are consistent with the proposed function of HIF-1 as a physiologic regulator of gene expression that responds to changes in cellular oxygen tension. Methylation interference analysis indicated that HIF-1 makes specific contacts with DNA in the major groove.},

abstract = {In response to Wnt stimulation, ??-catenin accumulates and activates target genes. Using modeling and experimental analysis, we found that the level of ??-catenin is sensitive to perturbations in the pathway, such that cellular variation would be expected to alter the signaling outcome. One unusual parameter was robust: the fold-change in ??-catenin level (post-Wnt/pre-Wnt). In Xenopus, dorsal-anterior development and target gene expression are robust to perturbations that alter the final level but leave the fold-change intact. These suggest, first, that despite cellular noise, the cell responds reliably to Wnt stimulation by maintaining a robust fold-change in ??-catenin. Second, the transcriptional machinery downstream of the Wnt pathway does not simply read the ??-catenin level after Wnt stimulation but computes fold-changes in ??-catenin. Analogous to Weber's Law in sensory physiology, some gene transcription networks must respond to fold-changes in signals, rather than absolute levels, which may buffer stochastic, genetic, and environmental variation. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Recent experiments suggest such a fold-change detection feature in signaling systems in cells: a response that depends on the fold-change in the input signal, and not on its absolute level. It is therefore of interest to find molecular mechanisms of gene regulation that can provide such fold-change detection. Here, we demonstrate theoretically that fold-change detection can be generated by one of the most common network motifs in transcription networks, the incoherent feedforward loop (I1-FFL), in which an activator regulates both a gene and a repressor of the gene. The fold-change detection feature of the I1-FFL applies to the entire shape of the response, including its amplitude and duration, and is valid for a wide range of biochemical parameters. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Examples include bifunctional enzymes that carry out two opposing reactions such as phosphorylating and dephosphorylating the same target, regulators that activate and also repress a gene in circuits called incoherent feedforward loops, and cytokines that signal immune cells to both proliferate and die.

Networks of interacting molecules, such as transcription networks, have been shown to be composed of recurring circuits called network motifs, each with specific dynamical functions. Much less is known about the possibility of such circuit analysis in networks made of communicating cells. Here, we study models of circuits in which a few cell types interact by means of signaling molecules. We consider circuits of cells with architectures that seem to recur in immunology. An intriguing feature of these circuits is their use of signaling molecules with a pleiotropic or paradoxical role, such as cytokines that increase both cell growth and cell death. We find that pleiotropic signaling molecules can provide cell circuits with systems-level functions. These functions include for different circuits maintenance of homeostatic cell concentrations, robust regulation of differentiation processes, and robust pulses of cells or cytokines.},

The corresponding proteins, AHR-1 and AHA-1, share biochemical properties with their mammalian cognates. Specifically, AHR-1 forms a tight association with HSP90, and AHR-1 and AHA-1 interact to bind DNA fragments containing the mammalian xenobiotic response element with sequence specificity. Yeast expression studies indicate that \emph{C. elegans} AHR-1, like vertebrate AHR, requires some form of post- translational activation. Moreover, this requirement depends on the presence of the domains predicted to mediate binding of HSP90 and ligand. Preliminary experiments suggest that if AHR-1 is ligand-activated, its spectrum of ligands is different from that of the mammalian receptor: \emph{C. elegans} AHR-1 is not photoaffinity labeled by a dioxin analog, and it is not activated by j-naphthoflavone in the yeast system.

abstract = {Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central regulator of protein synthesis whose activity is modulated by a variety of signals. Energy depletion and hypoxia result in mTOR inhibition. While energy depletion inhibits mTOR through a process involving the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by LKB1 and subsequent phosphorylation of TSC2, the mechanism of mTOR inhibition by hypoxia is not known. Here we show that mTOR inhibition by hypoxia requires the TSC1/TSC2 tumor suppressor complex and the hypoxia-inducible gene REDD1/RTP801. Disruption of the TSC1/TSC2 complex through loss of TSC1 or TSC2 blocks the effects of hypoxia on mTOR, as measured by changes in the mTOR targets S6K and 4E-BP1, and results in abnormal accumulation of Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). In contrast to energy depletion, mTOR inhibition by hypoxia does not require AMPK or LKB1. Down-regulation of mTOR activity by hypoxia requires de novo mRNA synthesis and correlates with increased expression of the hypoxia-inducible REDD1 gene. Disruption of REDD1 abrogates the hypoxia-induced inhibition of mTOR, and REDD1 overexpression is sufficient to down-regulate S6K phosphorylation in a TSC1/TSC2-dependent manner. Inhibition of mTOR function by hypoxia is likely to be important for tumor suppression as TSC2-deficient cells maintain abnormally high levels of cell proliferation under hypoxia.},

A critical cell-autonomous adaptive response to chronic hypoxia controlled by HIF-1 is reduced mitochondrial mass and/or metabolism. Exposure of HIF-1-deficient fibroblasts to chronic hypoxia results in cell death due to excessive levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). HIF-1 reduces ROS production under hypoxic conditions by multiple mechanisms including: a subunit switch in cytochrome c oxidase from the COX4-1 to COX4-2 regulatory subunit that increases the efficiency of complex IV; induction of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, which shunts pyruvate away from the mitochondria; induction of BNIP3, which triggers mitochondrial selective autophagy; and induction of microRNA-210, which blocks assembly of Fe/S clusters that are required for oxidative phosphorylation. HIF-1 is also required for ischemic preconditioning and this effect may be due in part to its induction of CD73, the enzyme that produces adenosine. HIF-1-dependent regulation of mitochondrial metabolism may also contribute to the protective effects of ischemic preconditioning.

Which components of the translation machinery control hypoxic sensitivity and the precise mechanism has not been systematically investigated, although a reduction in oxygen consumption has been widely assumed to be the mechanism. Using genetic reagents in \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans}, we examined the effect on organismal survival after hypoxia of knockdown of 10 factors functioning at the three principal steps in translation. Reduction-of-function of all 10 translation factors significantly increased hypoxic survival to varying degrees, not fully accounted for by the level of translational suppression. Measurement of oxygen consumption showed that strong hypoxia resistance was possible without a significant decrease in oxygen consumption. Hypoxic sensitivity had no correlation with lifespan or reactive oxygen species sensitivity, two phenotypes associated with reduced translation. Resistance to tunicamycin, which produces misfolded protein toxicity, was the only phenotype that significantly correlated with hypoxic sensitivity. Translation factor knockdown was also hypoxia protective for mouse primary neurons. These data show that translation factor knockdown is hypoxia protective in both \emph{C. elegans} and mouse neurons and that oxygen consumption does not necessarily determine survival; rather, mitigation of misfolded protein toxicity is more strongly associated with hypoxic protection.},

abstract = {Pore-forming toxins (PFTs) are by far the most abundant bacterial protein toxins and are important for the virulence of many important pathogens. As such, cellular responses to PFTs critically modulate host-pathogen interactions. Although many cellular responses to PFTs have been recorded, little is understood about their relevance to pathological or defensive outcomes. To shed light on this important question, we have turned to the only genetic system for studying PFT-host interactions-Caenorhabditis elegans intoxication by Crystal (Cry) protein PFTs. We mutagenized and screened for \emph{C. elegans} mutants resistant to a Cry PFT and recovered one mutant. Complementation, sequencing, transgenic rescue, and RNA interference data demonstrate that this mutant eliminates a gene normally involved in repression of the hypoxia (low oxygen response) pathway. We find that up-regulation of the \emph{C. elegans} hypoxia pathway via the inactivation of three different genes that normally repress the pathway results in animals resistant to Cry PFTs. Conversely, mutation in the central activator of the hypoxia response, HIF-1, suppresses this resistance and can result in animals defective in PFT defenses. These results extend to a PFT that attacks mammals since up-regulation of the hypoxia pathway confers resistance to Vibrio cholerae cytolysin (VCC), whereas down-regulation confers hypersusceptibility. The hypoxia PFT defense pathway acts cell autonomously to protect the cells directly under attack and is different from other hypoxia pathway stress responses. Two of the downstream effectors of this pathway include the nuclear receptor nhr-57 and the unfolded protein response. In addition, the hypoxia pathway itself is induced by PFT, and low oxygen is protective against PFT intoxication. These results demonstrate that hypoxia and induction of the hypoxia response protect cells against PFTs, and that the cellular environment can be modulated via the hypoxia pathway to protect against the most prevalent class of weapons used by pathogenic bacteria.},

abstract = {Single-cell genomics has now made it possible to create a comprehensive atlas of human cells. At the same time, it has reopened definitions of a cell's identity and of the ways in which identity is regulated by the cell's molecular circuitry. Emerging computational analysis methods, especially in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), have already begun to reveal, in a data-driven way, the diverse simultaneous facets of a cell's identity, from discrete cell types to continuous dynamic transitions and spatial locations. These developments will eventually allow a cell to be represented as a superposition of 'basis vectors', each determining a different (but possibly dependent) aspect of cellular organization and function. However, computational methods must also overcome considerable challenges—from handling technical noise and data scale to forming new abstractions of biology. As the scale of single-cell experiments continues to increase, new computational approaches will be essential for constructing and characterizing a reference map of cell identities.},

Quality control machineries respond to errors during protein synthesis by refolding polypeptides or targeting them for degradation. As another layer of gene expression control, aberrant mRNAs can also be detected and eliminated by mRNA quality control systems while engaging the ribosome. In this review, I focus on recent studies on the cotranslational quality control mechanisms induced by abnormal translational elongation and termination, which result in the rapid degradation of aberrant polypeptides and mRNAs. Emerging evidence indicates that the ribosome has central roles in quality control processes, acting as a platform for discrimination during protein biogenesis and for initiation of downstream events that determine the fate of aberrant polypeptides and mRNAs.},

abstract = {Hypoxia has recently been shown to activate the endoplasmic reticulum kinase PERK, leading to phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and inhibition of mRNA translation initiation. Using a quantitative assay, we show that this inhibition exhibits a biphasic response mediated through two distinct pathways. The first occurs rapidly, reaching a maximum at 1-2 h and is due to phosphorylation of eIF2alpha. Continued hypoxic exposure activates a second, eIF2alpha-independent pathway that maintains repression of translation. This phase is characterized by disruption of eIF4F and sequestration of eIF4E by its inhibitor 4E-BP1 and transporter 4E-T. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of polysomal RNA indicates that the translation efficiency of individual genes varies widely during hypoxia. Furthermore, the translation efficiency of individual genes is dynamic, changing dramatically during hypoxic exposure due to the initial phosphorylation and subsequent dephosphorylation of eIF2alpha. Together, our data indicate that acute and prolonged hypoxia regulates mRNA translation through distinct mechanisms, each with important contributions to hypoxic gene expression.},

abstract = {Human acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA, EC 3.2.1.20) is a lysosomal enzyme that belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 31 (GH31) and catalyses the hydrolysis of alpha-1,4- and alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages at acid pH. Hereditary deficiency of GAA results in lysosomal glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII, Pompe disease). The aim of this study was to assess GH31 proteins in \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} (C. elegans) to identify the ortholog of human GAA. Bioinformatic searches for GAA ortholog in \emph{C. elegans} genome revealed four acid alpha-glucosidase-related (aagr-1-4) genes. Multiple sequence alignment of AAGRs with other GH31 proteins demonstrated their evolutionary conservation. Phylogenetic analyses suggested clustering of AAGR-1 and -2 with acid-active and AAGR-3 and -4 with neutral-active GH31 enzymes. In order to prove the AAGRs' predicted alpha-glucosidase activity, we performed RNA interference of all four aagr genes. The impact on the alpha-glucosidase activity was evaluated at pH 4.0 (acid) and pH 6.5 (neutral), with or without the inhibitor acarbose. AAGR-1 and -2 expressed acidic alpha-glucosidase activity; on the contrary, AAGR-3 not -4 represented the predominant neutral alpha-glucosidase activity in \emph{C. elegans}. Similar results were obtained in each of aagr-1 and -4 deletion mutants. Moreover, based on our structural models of AAGRs and these biochemical experiments, we hypothesize that the enzymatic sensitivity of AAGR-2 and human maltase-glucoamylase to the inhibitor acarbose is associated with a tyrosine residue in the GH31 active site, whereas acarbose resistance of AAGR-1 and human GAA is associated with the corresponding tryptophane in the active site. Acid-active AAGR-1 may thus represent the ortholog of human GAA in \emph{C. elegans}.},

abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can be repaired by homologous recombination (HR), which can involve Holliday junction (HJ) intermediates that are ultimately resolved by nucleolytic enzymes. An N-terminal fragment of human GEN1 has recently been shown to act as a Holliday junction resolvase, but little is known about the role of GEN-1 in vivo. Holliday junction resolution signifies the completion of DNA repair, a step that may be coupled to signaling proteins that regulate cell cycle progression in response to DNA damage. Using forward genetic approaches, we identified a \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} dual function DNA double-strand break repair and DNA damage signaling protein orthologous to the human GEN1 Holliday junction resolving enzyme. GEN-1 has biochemical activities related to the human enzyme and facilitates repair of DNA double-strand breaks, but is not essential for DNA double-strand break repair during meiotic recombination. Mutational analysis reveals that the DNA damage-signaling function of GEN-1 is separable from its role in DNA repair. GEN-1 promotes germ cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a pathway that acts in parallel to the canonical DNA damage response pathway mediated by RPA loading, CHK1 activation, and CEP-1/p53-mediated apoptosis induction. Furthermore, GEN-1 acts redundantly with the 9-1-1 complex to ensure genome stability. Our study suggests that GEN-1 might act as a dual function Holliday junction resolvase that may coordinate DNA damage signaling with a late step in DNA double-strand break repair.},

FH-associated neoplasia is characterized by defective mitochondrial function and by upregulation of transcriptional pathways mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), although whether and by what means these processes are linked has been disputed. We analysed the HIF pathway in Fh1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), in FH-defective neoplastic tissues and in Fh1-/- MEFs re-expressing either wild-type or an extra-mitochondrial restricted form of FH. These experiments demonstrated that upregulation of HIF-1alpha occurs as a direct consequence of FH inactivation. Fh1-/- cells accumulated intracellular fumarate and manifested severe impairment of HIF prolyl but not asparaginyl hydroxylation which was corrected by provision of exogenous 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG). Re-expression of the extra-mitochondrial form of FH in Fh1-/- cells was sufficient to reduce intracellular fumarate and to correct dysregulation of the HIF pathway completely, even in cells that remained profoundly defective in mitochondrial energy metabolism. The findings indicate that upregulation of HIF-1alpha arises from competitive inhibition of the 2-OG-dependent HIF hydroxylases by fumarate and not from disruption of mitochondrial energy metabolism.},

Our goal was to identify the elements that regulate and contribute to the development of RRC and its involvement in cell survival. The results show that activation of metabolic sensors, including pyruvate dehydrogenase and AMP-dependent kinase, increases cardiac myocyte RRC via a Sirt3-dependent mechanism. Notably, we identified mitochondrial complex II (cII) as a target of these metabolic sensors and the main source of RRC. Moreover, we show that RRC, via cII, correlates with enhanced cell survival after hypoxia. Thus, for the first time, we show that metabolic sensors via Sirt3 maximize the cellular RRC through activating cII, which enhances cell survival after hypoxia.},

abstract = {Defects of the oxidative ATP production pathway lead to an amazing variety of disease phenotypes, ranging from childhood encephalomyopathies to hereditary tumor formation. A key enzyme of tricarboxylic cycle, fumarate hydratase (FH), is involved in encephalopathies, but also in leiomyoma formation, and occasionally also in various types of cancer. MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) and NARP (neuropathy ataxia retinitis pigmentosa) are progressive neurological disorders, caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations and respiratory chain (RC) deficiency. These diseases lead to disability and premature death, but not to tumorigenesis. We studied the cellular consequences of FH and RC deficiencies, aiming to identify general responses to energy metabolism defect and those specific for FH-deficiency, suggestively connected to tumorigenesis. Unlike in RC deficiency, the FH-deficient diploid human fibroblasts showed no signs of oxidative stress, but had a reduced redox state with high glutathione levels. The cytoplasmic FH isoform, previously described, but with an unknown function, was completely lacking in all FH-deficient lines. Fumarate was increased in two of our FH-lines, but accumulation of HIF-1$\alpha$ was not detected. Glycolysis was induced in both MELAS and in FH-deficiency. Accumulation of fumarate in primary fibroblasts did not activate a hypoxia response, suggesting that hypoxia activation due to fumarate accumulation may be a tissue-specific response. The lack of cytoplasmic form of FH and the reduced redox environment were typical for all FH-mutant lines, and their role in FH-related tumorigenesis requires further attention. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Individuals with HLRCC are at risk to develop cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas and an aggressive form of kidney cancer. Pseudohypoxic drive-the aberrant activation of cellular hypoxia response pathways despite normal oxygen tension-is considered to be a likely mechanism underlying the etiology of this tumor. Pseudohypoxia requires the oxygen-independent stabilization of the alpha subunit of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF-1alpha). Under normoxic conditions, proline hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha permits VHL recognition and subsequent targeting for proteasomal degradation. Here, we demonstrate that inactivating mutations of FH in an HLRCC-derived cell line result in glucose-mediated generation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS-dependent HIF-1alpha stabilization. Additionally, we demonstrate that stable knockdown of FH in immortalized renal epithelial cells results in ROS-dependent HIF-1alpha stabilization. These data reveal that the obligate glycolytic switch present in HLRCC is critical to HIF stabilization via ROS generation.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a heterodimeric basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that regulates hypoxia-inducible genes including the human erythropoietin (EPO) gene. In this study, we report structural features of the HIF-1alpha subunit that are required for heterodimerization, DNA binding, and transactivation. The HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta (ARNT; aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) subunits were coimmunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts, indicating that these proteins heterodimerize in the absence of DNA. In vitro-translated HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta generated a HIF-1/DNA complex with similar electrophoretic mobility and sequence specificity as HIF-1 present in nuclear extracts from hypoxic cells. Compared to 826-amino acid, full-length HIF-1alpha, amino acids 1-166 mediated heterodimerization with HIF-1beta (ARNT), but amino acids 1-390 were required for optimal DNA binding. A deletion involving the basic domain of HIF-1alpha eliminated DNA binding without affecting heterodimerization. In cotransfection assays, forced expression of recombinant HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta (ARNT) activated transcription of reporter genes containing EPO enhancer sequences with intact, but not mutant, HIF-1 binding sites. Deletion of the carboxy terminus of HIF-1alpha (amino acids 391-826) markedly decreased the ability of recombinant HIF-1 to activate transcription. Overexpression of a HIF-1alpha construct with deletions of the basic domain and carboxy terminus blocked reporter gene activation by endogenous HIF-1 in hypoxic cells.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a heterodimeric transcription factor that is critical for hypoxic induction of a number of physiologically important genes. We present evidence that regulation of HIF-1 activity is primarily determined by the stability of the HIF-1alpha protein. Both HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta mRNAs were constitutively expressed in HeLa and Hep3B cells with no significant induction by hypoxia. However, the HIF-1alpha protein was barely detectable in normoxic cells, even when HIF-1alpha was overexpressed, but was highly induced in hypoxic cells, whereas HIF-1beta protein levels remained constant, regardless of pO2. Hypoxia-induced HIF-1 binding as well as the HIF-1alpha protein were rapidly and drastically decreased in vivo following an abrupt increase to normal oxygen tension. Moreover, short pre-exposure of cells to hydrogen peroxide selectively prevented hypoxia-induced HIF-1 binding via blocking accumulation of HIF-1alpha protein, whereas treatment of hypoxic cell extracts with H2O2 had no effect on HIF-1 binding. These observations suggest that an intact redox-dependent signaling pathway is required for destablization of the HIF-1alpha protein. In hypoxic cell extracts, HIF-1 DNA binding was reversibly abolished by sulfhydryl oxidation. Furthermore, the addition of reduced thioredoxin to cell extracts enhanced HIF-1 DNA binding. Consistent with these results, overexpression of thioredoxin and Ref-1 significantly potentiated hypoxia-induced expression of a reporter construct containing the wild-type HIF-1 binding site. These experiments indicate that activation of HIF-1 involves redox-dependent stabilization of HIF-1alpha protein.},

Characterization of the T. adhaerens PHDs and cross-species complementation assays reveal a conserved oxygen-sensing mechanism.

The best documented function of VHL protein (pVHL) relates to its ability to target the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) for polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. This chapter focuses on studies published over the past 2 years related to pVHL. These studies include those describing genetically engineered mice that were used to interrogate the relationship between pVHL and HIF in vivo and cell culture studies that underscore the importance of pVHL in epithelial differentiation and maintenance of the primary cilium. In addition, recent work suggests that pVHL regulates neuronal apoptosis in an HIF-independent manner, and this activity is linked to the risk of developing pheochromocytoma. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Collagen production is fundamental for the ontogeny and the phylogeny of all multicellular organisms. It depends on hydroxylation of proline residues, a reaction that uses molecular oxygen as a substrate. This dependency is expected to limit collagen production to oxygenated cells. However, during embryogenesis, cells in different tissues that develop under low oxygen levels must produce this essential protein. In this study, using the growth plate of developing bones as a model system, we identify the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 $\alpha$ (HIF1$\alpha$) as a central component in a mechanism that underlies collagen hydroxylation and secretion by hypoxic cells. We show that Hif1a loss of function in growth plate chondrocytes arrests the secretion of extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen type II. Reduced collagen hydroxylation and endoplasmic reticulum stress induction in Hif1a-depleted cells suggests that HIF1$\alpha$ regulates collagen secretion by mediating its hydroxylation and consequently its folding. We demonstrate in vivo the ability of Hif1$\alpha$ to drive the transcription of collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase, which catalyzes collagen hydroxylation. We also show that, concurrently, HIF1$\alpha$ maintains cellular levels of oxygen, most likely by controlling the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, an inhibitor of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Through this two-armed mechanism, HIF1$\alpha$ acts as a central regulator of collagen production that allows chondrocytes to maintain their function as professional secretory cells in the hypoxic growth plate. As hypoxic conditions occur also during pathological conditions such as cancer, our findings may promote the understanding not only of embryogenesis, but also of pathological processes.},

The molecular physiology of this state has not been studied as intensely as other parts of the life cycle, in spite of documented changes in behavior and metabolism that occur at this stage. To study the female state of \emph{C. elegans}, we designed an experiment to measure the transcriptome of 1st day adult females, endogenous, 6th day adult females, as well as mutant feminized worms that never go through a hermaphrodite stage at these time points. Using this experimental design, we were able to measure the effects of biological aging from the transition into the female state. We find that spermless young adult animals partially phenocopy 6 day old wild-type animals that have depleted their sperm after egg-laying, and that spermless animals also exhibit less transcriptomic changes associated with aging throughout these 6 days. Our results indicate that sperm loss triggers naturally ocurring transcriptomic changes},

This complex consists of HIF-1 and AHA-1, which are encoded by \emph{C. elegans} homologs of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha and beta subunits, respectively. hif-1 mutants exhibit no severe defects under standard laboratory conditions, but they are unable to adapt to hypoxia. Although wild-type animals can survive and reproduce in 1{\%} oxygen, the majority of hif-1-defective animals die in these conditions. We show that the expression of an HIF-1:green fluorescent protein fusion protein is induced by hypoxia and is subsequently reduced upon reoxygenation. Both hif-1 and aha-1 are expressed in most cell types, and the gene products can be coimmunoprecipitated. We conclude that the mechanisms of hypoxia signaling are likely conserved among metazoans. Additionally, we find that nuclear localization of AHA-1 is disrupted in an hif-1 mutant. This finding suggests that heterodimerization may be a prerequisite for efficient nuclear translocation of AHA-1.},

abstract = {In normoxic cells the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and activation of HIF-1 alpha to a functional form requires protein stabilization. Here we show that the product of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene mediated ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of HIF-1 alpha under normoxic conditions via interaction with the core of the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1 alpha. The region of VHL mediating interaction with HIF-1 alpha overlapped with a putative macromolecular binding site observed within the crystal structure of VHL. This motif of VHL also represents a mutational hotspot in tumors, and one of these mutations impaired interaction with HIF-1 alpha and subsequent degradation. Interestingly, the VHL binding site within HIF-1 alpha overlapped with one of the minimal transactivation domains. Protection of HIF-1 alpha against degradation by VHL was a multistep mechanism, including hypoxia-induced nuclear translocation of HIF-1 alpha and an intranuclear hypoxia-dependent signal. VHL was not released from HIF-1 alpha during this process. Finally, stabilization of HIF-1 alpha protein levels per se did not totally bypass the need of the hypoxic signal for generating the transactivation response.},

abstract = {High-throughput expression profiling enables the global study of gene activities. Genes with positively correlated expression profiles are likely to encode functionally related proteins. However, all biological processes are interlocked, and each protein may play multiple cellular roles. Thus the coexpression of any two functionally related genes may depend on the constantly varying, yet often-unknown cellular state. To initiate a systematic study on this issue, a theory of coexpression dynamics is presented. This theory is used to rationalize a strategy of conducting a genome-wide search for the most critical cellular players that may affect the coexpression pattern of any two genes. In one example, using a yeast data set, our method reveals how the enzymes associated with the urea cycle are expressed to ensure proper mass flow of the involved metabolites. The correlation between ARG2 and CAR2 is found to change from positive to negative as the expression level of CPA2 increases. This delicate interplay in correlation signifies a remarkable control on the influx and efflux of ornithine and reflects well the intrinsic cellular demand for arginine. In addition to the urea cycle, our examples include SCH9 and CYR1 (both implicated in a recent longevity study), cytochrome c1 (mitochondrial electron transport), calmodulin (main calcium-binding protein), PFK1 and PFK2 (glycolysis), and two genes, ECM1 and YNL101W, the functions of which are newly revealed. The complexity in computation is eased by a new result from mathematical statistics.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a transcriptional complex that plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression by oxygen. In oxygenated and iron replete cells, HIF-alpha subunits are rapidly destroyed by a mechanism that involves ubiquitylation by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) E3 ligase complex. This process is suppressed by hypoxia and iron chelation, allowing transcriptional activation. Here we show that the interaction between human pVHL and a specific domain of the HIF-1alpha subunit is regulated through hydroxylation of a proline residue (HIF-1alpha P564) by an enzyme we have termed HIF-alpha prolyl-hydroxylase (HIF-PH). An absolute requirement for dioxygen as a cosubstrate and iron as cofactor suggests that HIF-PH functions directly as a cellular oxygen sensor.},

We found 22,163 such coexpression relationships, each of which has been conserved across evolution. This conservation implies that the coexpression of these gene pairs confers a selective advantage and therefore that these genes are functionally related. Manyof these relationships provide strong evidence for the involvement of new genes in core biological functions such as the cell cycle, secretion, and protein expression. We experimentallyconfirmed the predictions implied bysome of these links and identified cell proliferation functions for several genes. By assembling these links into a gene-coexpression network, we found several components that were animal-specific as well as interrelationships between newly evolved and ancient modules.},

abstract = {T he backbone of scientific computing is mostly a collection of high-perfor-mance code written in Fortran, C, and C++ that typically runs in batch mode on large systems, clusters, and supercomputers. However, over the past decade, high-level environ-ments that integrate easy-to-use interpreted lan-guages, comprehensive numerical libraries, and visualization facilities have become extremely popu-lar in this field. As hardware becomes faster, the crit-ical bottleneck in scientific computing isn't always the computer's processing time; the scientist's time is also a consideration. For this reason, systems that allow rapid algorithmic exploration, data analysis, and vi-sualization have become a staple of daily scientific work. The Interactive Data Language (IDL) and Matlab (for numerical work), and Mathematica and Maple (for work that includes symbolic manipula-tion) are well-known commercial environments of this kind. GNU Data Language, Octave, Maxima and Sage provide their open source counterparts. All these systems offer an interactive command line in which code can be run immediately, without having to go through the traditional edit/com-pile/execute cycle. This flexible style matches well the spirit of computing in a scientific context, in which determining what computations must be performed next often requires significant work. An interactive environment lets scientists look at data, test new ideas, combine algorithmic approaches, and evaluate their outcome directly. This process might lead to a final result, or it might clarify how they need to build a more static, large-scale pro-duction code. As this article shows, Python (www.python.org) is an excellent tool for such a workflow. 1 The IPython project (http://ipython.scipy.org) aims to not only provide a greatly enhanced Python shell but also facilities for interactive distributed and par-allel computing, as well as a comprehensive set of tools for building special-purpose interactive envi-ronments for scientific computing.},

abstract = {The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL) has attracted intensive interest not only because its mutations predispose carriers to devastating tumors, but also because it is involved in oxygen sensing under physiological conditions. VHL loss-of-function mutations result in organ-specific tumors, such as hemangioblastoma of the central nervous system and renal cell carcinoma, both untreatable with conventional chemotherapies. The VHL protein is best known as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha), but many diverse, non-canonical cellular functions have also been assigned to VHL, mainly based on studies in cell culture systems. As such, although the HIF-dependent role of VHL is critical, the full spectrum of pathophysiological functions of VHL is still unresolved. Such understanding requires careful cross-referencing with physiologically relevant experimental models. Studies in model systems, such as \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans}, Drosophila, zebrafish and mouse have provided critical in vivo confirmation of the VHL-HIF pathway, and verification of potentially important cellular functions including microtubule stabilization and epithelial morphogenesis. More recently, animal models have also suggested systemic roles of VHL in hematopoiesis, metabolic homeostasis and inflammation. In this review, the studies performed in model organisms will be summarized and placed in context with existing clinical and in vitro data.

Phagocytic cells have an essential role in innate immune defence against pathogens and this is a battle that takes place mainly in the hypoxic microenvironments of infected tissues. It has now become clear that HIF promotes the bactericidal activities of phagocytic cells and supports the innate immune functions of dendritic cells, mast cells and epithelial cells. In response to microbial pathogens, HIF expression is upregulated through pathways involving the key immune response regulator nuclear factor-kappaB, highlighting an interdependence of the innate immune and hypoxic responses to infection and tissue damage. In turn, HIF-driven innate immune responses have important consequences for both the pathogen and the host, such that the tissue microenvironment fundamentally influences susceptibility to infectious disease.},

We identified two prominent neoblast classes that we named z (zeta) and s (sigma). Zeta-neoblasts encompass specified cells that give rise to an abundant postmitotic lineage, including epidermal cells, and are not required for regeneration. By contrast, sigma-neoblasts proliferate in response to injury, possess broad lineage capacity, and can give rise to zeta-neoblasts. These findings indicate that planarian neoblasts comprise two major and functionally distinct cellular compartments.},

We find extensive, and previously unobserved, bimodal variation in messenger RNA abundance and splicing patterns, which we validate by RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization for select transcripts. In particular, hundreds of key immune genes are bimodally expressed across cells, surprisingly even for genes that are very highly expressed at the population average. Moreover, splicing patterns demonstrate previously unobserved levels of heterogeneity between cells. Some of the observed bimodality can be attributed to closely related, yet distinct, known maturity states of BMDCs; other portions reflect differences in the usage of key regulatory circuits. For example, we identify a module of 137 highly variable, yet co-regulated, antiviral response genes. Using cells from knockout mice, we show that variability in this module may be propagated through an interferon feedback circuit, involving the transcriptional regulators Stat2 and Irf7. Our study demonstrates the power and promise of single-cell genomics in uncovering functional diversity between cells and in deciphering cell states and circuits.},

abstract = {Solute Carrier Family 1, member 5 (SLC1A5), also named as ASCT2, a major glutamine transporter, is highly expressed in various malignancies and plays a critical role in the transformation, growth and survival of cancer cells. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical significance of SLC1A5 in patients with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). SLC1A5 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. Kaplan-Meier method was conducted to compare survival curves. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were applied to assess the impact of prognostic factors on overall survival (OS). A nomogram was then constructed on the basis of the independent prognosticators identified on multivariate analysis. The predictive ability of the models was compared using Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Our data indicated that high expression of SLC1A5 was significantly associated with advanced TNM stage, higher Fuhrman grade and shorter OS in ccRCC patients. Multivariate analysis confirmed that SLC1A5 was an independent prognosticator for OS. A nomogram integrating SLC1A5 and other independent prognosticators was constructed, which showed a better prognostic value for OS than TNM staging system. In conclusion, high SLC1A5 expression is an independent predictor of adverse clinical outcome in ccRCC patients after surgery.},

Cuffdiff 2 robustly identifies differentially expressed transcripts and genes and reveals differential splicing and promoter-preference changes. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach through differential analysis of lung fibroblasts in response to loss of the developmental transcription factor HOXA1, which we show is required for lung fibroblast and HeLa cell cycle progression. Loss of HOXA1 results in significant expression level changes in thousands of individual transcripts, along with isoform switching events in key regulators of the cell cycle.

abstract = {S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) is a universal biological cofactor that is found in all branches of life where it plays a critical role in the transfer of methyl groups to various biomolecules, including DNA, proteins and small-molecule secondary metabolites. The methylation process thus has important implications in various disease processes and applications in industrial chemical processing. This methyl transfer is catalysed by SAM-dependent methyltransferases (MTases), which are by far the largest groups of SAM-dependent enzymes. A significant amount is now known regarding the structural biology and enzymology of these enzymes, and, consequently, there is now significant scope for the development of new MTases and SAM analogues for applications from biomolecular imaging to biocatalytic industrial processes. This review will focus on current efforts in the manipulation of class I and V SAM-dependent MTases and the use of synthetic SAM analogues, which together offer the best prospects for rational redesign towards biotechnological applications. Firstly, metabolic engineering of organisms incorporating small-molecule MTases is discussed; this can be applied in a variety of areas from the industrial bioprocessing of flavourants and antibiotics to frontier research in biofuel production and bioremediation. Secondly, the application of MTases in combination with SAM analogues is reviewed; this allows the tagging of proteins and oligonucleotides with moieties other than the methyl group. Such tagging allows the isolation of the tagged biomolecule and aids its visualisation by a range of analytical methods. The review then summarises the potential advantages of MTase-mediated chemistry and offers some future perspectives on downstream applications.},

abstract = {In both metazoan development and metastatic cancer, migrating cells must carry out a detailed, complex program of sensing cues, binding substrates, and moving their cytoskeletons. The linker cell in \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} males undergoes a stereotyped migration that guides gonad organogenesis, occurs with precise timing, and requires the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-67. To better understand how this occurs, we performed RNA-seq of individually staged and dissected linker cells, comparing transcriptomes from linker cells of third-stage (L3) larvae, fourth-stage (L4) larvae, and nhr-67-RNAi-treated L4 larvae. We observed expression of 8,000-10,000 genes in the linker cell, 22-25{\%} of which were up- or down-regulated 20-fold during development by NHR-67. Of genes that we tested by RNAi, 22{\%} (45 of 204) were required for normal shape and migration, suggesting that many NHR-67-dependent, linker cell-enriched genes play roles in this migration. One unexpected class of genes up-regulated by NHR-67 was tandem pore potassium channels, which are required for normal linker-cell migration. We also found phenotypes for genes with human orthologs but no previously described migratory function. Our results provide an extensive catalog of genes that act in a migrating cell, identify unique molecular functions involved in nematode cell migration, and suggest similar functions in humans.},

Historically, neoblasts have largely been considered a homogeneous stem cell population. Most studies, however, analyzed neoblasts at the population rather than the single-cell level, leaving the degree of heterogeneity in this population unresolved. We combined RNA sequencing of neoblasts from wounded planarians with expression screening and identified 33 transcription factors transcribed in specific differentiated cells and in small fractions of neoblasts during regeneration. Many neoblast subsets expressing distinct tissue-associated transcription factors were present, suggesting candidate specification into many lineages. Consistent with this possibility, klf, pax3/7, and FoxA were required for the differentiation of cintillo-expressing sensory neurons, dopamine-??-hydroxylase-expressing neurons, and the pharynx, respectively. Together, these results suggest that specification of cell fate for most-to-all regenerative lineages occurs within neoblasts, with regenerative cells of blastemas being generated from a highly heterogeneous collection of lineage-specified neoblasts. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

This distinct dysfunction module is downstream of intracellular metallothioneins that regulate zinc metabolism and can be identified at single-cell resolution. We further identify Gata-3, a zinc-finger transcription factor in the dysfunctional module, as a regulator of dysfunction, and we use CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to show that it drives a dysfunctional phenotype in CD8+ TILs.

Most of these processes are mediated by Hypoxia Inducible Factors, HIFs, a family of transcription factors that directly induce the expression of several hundred genes in mammalian cells. Although different aspects of HIF regulation are well known, it is still unclear by which precise mechanism HIFs activate transcription of their target genes. Concomitantly, hypoxia provokes a dramatic decrease of general transcription that seems to rely in part on epigenetic changes through a poorly understood mechanism. In this review we discuss the current knowledge on chromatin changes involved in HIF dependent gene activation, as well as on other epigenetic changes, not necessarily linked to HIF that take place under hypoxic conditions.},

A green fluorescence protein (GFP) promoter assay revealed ubiquitous expression of \emph{C. elegans} nog-1 from the early embryonic to the adult stage. Furthermore, the GFP-tagged NOG-1 protein is localized to the nucleus, whereas the aberrant NOG-1 protein is concentrated in the nucleolus. Functional studies of NOG-1 in \emph{C. elegans} further revealed that nog-1 knockdown resulted in smaller broodsize, slower growth, increased life span, and more fat storage. Moreover, nog-1 over-expression resulted in decreased life span. Taken together, our data suggest that nog-1 in \emph{C. elegans} may be an important player in regulating life span and fat storage via the insulin/IGF pathway.},

However, it is unclear whether pVHL exerts these mitotic regulatory functions in vivo as well. Here, we applied ischemic kidney injury to stimulate cell division in otherwise quiescent mouse adult kidneys. We show that in the short term (5.5 days after surgery), Vhl-deficient kidney cells demonstrate both spindle misorientation and aneuploidy. The spindle misorientation phenotype encompassed changes in directed cell division, which may manifest in the development of cystic lesions, whereas the aneuploidy phenotype involved the occurrence of lagging chromosomes but not chromosome bridges, indicative of mitotic checkpoint impairment. Intriguingly, in the long term (4 months after the ischemic insult), Vhl-deficient kidneys displayed a heterogeneous pattern of ccRCC precursor lesions, including cysts, clear cell-type cells, and dysplasia. Together, these data provide direct evidence for a key role of pVHL in mediating oriented cell division and faithful mitotic checkpoint function in the renal epithelium, emphasizing the importance of pVHL as a controller of mitotic fidelity in vivo.},

Impaired S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase activity in humans results in AdoHcy accumulation and severe pathological consequences. Hyperhomocysteinemia, which is characterized by elevated levels of homocysteine in blood, also exhibits a similar phenotype of AdoHcy accumulation due to the reversal of the direction of the S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase reaction. Inhibition of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase is also linked to antiviral effects. In this review the advantages of yeast as an experimental system to understand pathologies associated with AdoHcy accumulation will be discussed. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Aquaporin-5 (AQP5) is a water channel protein expressed on the apical surface of alveolar epithelial type I cells in distal rat lung, suggesting a role for AQP5 in regulating alveolar surface liquid tonicity and/or cell volume. We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying hypertonic induction of AQP5 in primary rat alveolar epithelial cells (AEC). Steady-state levels of AQP5 mRNA and protein were increased by exposure to sorbitol (200 mM in culture fluid) for 24 h. The increase in AQP5 was not accompanied by changes in mRNA half-life. Transduction of mouse lung epithelial (MLE-15) cells and primary rat AEC with lentivirus vectors encoding AQP5-luciferase demonstrated transcriptional activation of the reporter by exposure to hypertonic sorbitol solution. Hybridization of proteins from sorbitol-treated cells to a transcription factor DNA array demonstrated induction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) by hypertonicity, which was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Cotransfections of AQP5-luciferase with HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta expression plasmids in MLE-15 cells led to dose-dependent transcriptional enhancement, which was partially abrogated by mutagenesis of putative HIF-1alpha binding sites in the proximal AQP5 promoter. Importantly, hypertonic induction of AQP5 was significantly inhibited by preventing HIF-1alpha induction with small interfering RNA. Hypertonicity induced activation of a transiently transfected vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) hypoxia response element-driven luciferase construct and increased expression of endogenous VEGF. These results demonstrate that hypertonic induction of both AQP5 and VEGF is transcriptionally regulated and mediated, at least in part, by HIF-1alpha, suggesting a novel role for HIF-1alpha in modulating cellular adaptive responses to osmotic stress.},

Responses to hypoxia are orchestrated in part through activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor family of transcription factors (HIFs). Recently, two additional O(2)-sensitive signalling pathways have also been implicated: signalling through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase and signalling through activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Although they are activated independently, growing evidence suggests that HIF-, mTOR- and UPR-dependent responses to hypoxia act in an integrated way, influencing each other and common downstream pathways that affect gene expression, metabolism, cell survival, tumorigenesis and tumour growth.},

Intestinal specific transcription is dependent on binding of ELT-2 to GATA binding sites in an iron-dependent enhancer (IDE) located in ftn-1 and ftn-2 promoters, but the mechanism for iron regulation is unknown. Here, we identify HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor -1) as a negative regulator of ferritin transcription. HIF-1 binds to hypoxia-response elements (HREs) in the IDE in vitro and in vivo. Depletion of hif-1 by RNA interference blocks transcriptional inhibition of ftn-1 and ftn-2 reporters, and ftn-1 and ftn-2 mRNAs are not regulated in a hif-1 null strain during iron deficiency. An IDE is also present in smf-3 encoding a protein homologous to mammalian divalent metal transporter-1. Unlike the ftn-1 IDE, the smf-3 IDE is required for HIF-1-dependent transcriptional activation of smf-3 during iron deficiency. We show that hif-1 null worms grown under iron limiting conditions are developmentally delayed and that depletion of FTN-1 and FTN-2 rescues this phenotype. These data show that HIF-1 regulates intestinal iron homeostasis during iron deficiency by activating and inhibiting genes involved in iron uptake and storage.},

abstract = {The adaptive response to hypoxia is accompanied by widespread transcriptional changes that allow for prolonged survival in low oxygen. Many of these changes are directly regulated by the conserved hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) complex; however, even in its absence, many oxygen-sensitive transcripts in \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} are appropriately regulated in hypoxia. To identify mediators of these non-HIF-dependent responses, we established a hif-1 mutant reporter line that expresses GFP in hypoxia or when worms are treated with the hypoxia mimetic cobalt chloride (CoCl2). The reporter is selective and HIF-independent, in that it remains insensitive to a number of cellular stresses, but is unaffected by mutation of the prolyl hydroxylase egl-9, suggesting that the regulators of this response pathway are different from those controlling the HIF pathway. We used the HIF-independent reporter to screen a transcription factor RNAi library and identified genes that are required for hypoxia-sensitive and CoCl2-induced GFP expression. We identified the zinc finger protein BLMP-1 as a mediator of the HIF-independent response. We show that mutation of blmp-1 renders animals sensitive to hypoxic exposure and that blmp-1 is required for appropriate hypoxic-induced expression of HIF-independent transcripts. Further, we demonstrate that BLMP-1 is necessary for an increase of hypoxia-dependent histone acetylation within the promoter of a non-HIF-dependent hypoxia response gene.},

When oxygen levels are high, the HIF-1alpha subunit is hydroxylated and is targeted for degradation by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL). This regulatory pathway is evolutionarily conserved, and the \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} hif-1 and vhl-1 genes encode homologs of the HIF-1alpha subunit and VHL. To understand and describe more fully the molecular basis for hypoxia response in this important genetic model system, we compared hypoxia-induced changes in mRNA expression in wild-type, hif-1-deficient, and vhl-1-deficient \emph{C. elegans} using whole genome microarrays. These studies identified 110 hypoxia-regulated gene expression changes, 63 of which require hif-1 function. Mutation of vhl-1 abrogates most hif-1-dependent changes in mRNA expression. Genes regulated by \emph{C. elegans} hif-1 have predicted functions in signal transduction, metabolism, transport, and extracellular matrix remodeling. We examined the in vivo requirement for 16 HIF-1 target genes and discovered that the phy-2 prolyl 4-hydroxylase alpha subunit is critical for survival in hypoxic conditions. Some HIF-1 target genes negatively regulate formation of stress-resistant dauer larvae. The microarray data presented herein also provide clear evidence for an HIF-1-independent pathway for hypoxia response, and this pathway regulates the expression of multiple heat shock proteins and several transcription factors.},

HIFalpha protein levels are increased in most solid tumours and correlate with patient prognosis. The link between HIF and apoptosis, a major determinant of cancer progression and treatment outcome, is poorly understood. Here we show that \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} HIF-1 protects against DNA-damage-induced germ cell apoptosis by antagonizing the function of CEP-1, the homologue of the tumour suppressor p53. The antiapoptotic property of HIF-1 is mediated by means of transcriptional upregulation of the tyrosinase family member TYR-2 in the ASJ sensory neurons. TYR-2 is secreted by ASJ sensory neurons to antagonize CEP-1-dependent germline apoptosis. Knock down of the TYR-2 homologue TRP2 (also called DCT) in human melanoma cells similarly increases apoptosis, indicating an evolutionarily conserved function. Our findings identify a novel link between hypoxia and programmed cell death, and provide a paradigm for HIF-1 dictating apoptotic cell fate at a distance.},

The nematode \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} has proven to be an exceptionally powerful model for toxicological studies. Here, we develop novel technologies to describe the effects of cyanide toxicity with high spatiotemporal resolution. Importantly, we use these methods to examine the genetic underpinnings of cyanide resistance. \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} that lack the EGL-9 oxygen sensing enzyme have been shown to be resistant to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas produced by the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. We demonstrate that the cyanide resistance exhibited by egl-9 mutants is completely dependent on the HIF-1 hypoxia-inducible factor and is mediated by the cysl-2 cysteine synthase, which likely functions in metabolic pathways that inactivate cyanide. Further, the expression of cysl-2 correlates with the degree of cyanide resistance exhibited in each genetic background. We find that each mutant exhibits similar relative resistance to HCN gas on plates or to aqueous potassium cyanide in microfluidic chambers. The design of the microfluidic devices, in combination with real-time imaging, addresses a series of challenges presented by mutant phenotypes and by the chemical nature of the toxicant. The microfluidic assay produces a set of behavioral parameters with increased resolution that describe cyanide toxicity and resistance in \emph{C. elegans}, and this is particularly useful in analyzing subtle phenotypes. These multiparameter analyses of \emph{C. elegans} behavior hold great potential as a means to monitor the effects of toxicants or chemical interventions in real time and to study the biological networks that underpin toxicant resistance.},

Animals can respond to both absolute CO2 concentrations and changes in CO2 levels within seconds. Responses to CO2 do not reflect avoidance of acid pH but appear to define a new sensory response. Sensation of CO2 is promoted by the cGMP-gated ion channel subunits TAX-2 and TAX-4, but other pathways are also important. Robust CO2 avoidance in well fed animals requires inhibition of the DAF-16 forkhead transcription factor by the insulin-like receptor DAF-2. Starvation, which activates DAF-16, strongly suppresses CO2 avoidance. Exposure to hypoxia ({\textless}1{\%} O2) also suppresses CO2 avoidance via activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1. The npr-1 215V allele of the naturally polymorphic neuropeptide receptor npr-1, besides inhibiting avoidance of high ambient O2 in feeding \emph{C. elegans}, also promotes avoidance of high CO2. \emph{C. elegans} integrates competing O2 and CO2 sensory inputs so that one response dominates. Food and allelic variation at NPR-1 regulate which response prevails.

abstract = {Oxygen is fundamentally important for cell metabolism, and as a consequence, O₂ deprivation (hypoxia) can impair many essential physiological processes. Here, we show that an active response to hypoxia disrupts cellular proteostasis - the coordination of protein synthesis, quality control, and degradation that maintains the functionality of the proteome. We have discovered that specific hypoxic conditions enhance the aggregation and toxicity of aggregation-prone proteins that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Our data indicate this is an active response to hypoxia, rather than a passive consequence of energy limitation. This response to hypoxia is partially antagonized by the conserved hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, hif-1. We further demonstrate that exposure to hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) protects animals from hypoxia-induced disruption of proteostasis. H₂S has been shown to protect against hypoxic damage in mammals and extends lifespan in nematodes. Remarkably, our data also show that H₂S can reverse detrimental effects of hypoxia on proteostasis. Our data indicate that the protective effects of H₂S in hypoxia are mechanistically distinct from the effect of H₂S to increase lifespan and thermotolerance, suggesting that control of proteostasis and aging can be dissociated. Together, our studies reveal a novel effect of the hypoxia response in animals and provide a foundation to understand how the integrated proteostasis network is integrated with this stress response pathway.},

abstract = {Background: Ambient oxygen (O2) influences the behavior of organisms from bacteria to man. In \emph{C. elegans}, an atypical O2 binding soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), GCY-35, regulates O2 responses. However, how acute and chronic changes in O2 modify behavior is poorly understood. Results: Aggregating \emph{C. elegans} strains can respond to a reduction in ambient O2 by a rapid, reversible, and graded inhibition of roaming behavior. This aerokinetic response is mediated by GCY-35 and GCY-36 sGCs, which appear to become activated as O2 levels drop and to depolarize the AQR, PQR, and URX neurons. Coexpression of GCY-35 and GCY-36 is sufficient to transform olfactory neurons into O2 sensors. Natural variation at the npr-1 neuropeptide receptor alters both food-sensing and O 2-sensing circuits to reconfigure the salient features of the \emph{C. elegans} environment. When cultivated in 1{\%} O2 for a few hours, \emph{C. elegans} reset their preferred ambient O2, seeking instead of avoiding 0{\%}-5{\%} O2. This plasticity involves reprogramming the AQR, PQR, and URX neurons. Conclusions: To navigate O2 gradients, \emph{C. elegans} can modulate turning rates and speed of movement. Aerotaxis can be reprogrammed by experience or engineered artificially. We propose a model in which prolonged activation of the AQR, PQR, and URX neurons by low O2 switches on previously inactive O2 sensors. This enables aerotaxis to low O 2 environments and may encode a "memory" of previous cultivation in low O2. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes serious human infections, but effective treatments and the mechanisms mediating pathogenesis remain elusive. \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} shares innate immune pathways with humans, making it invaluable to investigate infection. To determine how P. aeruginosa disrupts host biology, we studied how P. aeruginosa kills \emph{C. elegans} in a liquid-based pathogenesis model. We found that P. aeruginosa-mediated killing does not require quorum-sensing pathways or host colonization. A chemical genetic screen revealed that iron chelators alleviate P. aeruginosa-mediated killing. Consistent with a role for iron in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis, the bacterial siderophore pyoverdin was required for virulence and was sufficient to induce a hypoxic response and death in the absence of bacteria. Loss of the \emph{C. elegans} hypoxia-inducing factor HIF-1, which regulates iron homeostasis, exacerbated P. aeruginosa pathogenesis, further linking hypoxia and killing. As pyoverdin is indispensable for virulence in mice, pyoverdin-mediated hypoxia is likely to be relevant in human pathogenesis. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A mild inhibition of mitochondrial respiration extends the life span of many organisms, including yeast, worms, flies, and mice [1-10], but the underlying mechanism is unknown. One environmental condition that reduces rates of respiration is hypoxia (low oxygen). Thus, it is possible that mechanisms that sense oxygen play a role in the longevity response to reduced respiration. The hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1 is a highly conserved transcription factor that activates genes that promote survival during hypoxia [11, 12]. In this study, we show that inhibition of respiration in \emph{C. elegans} can promote longevity by activating HIF-1. Through genome-wide screening, we found that RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of many genes encoding respiratory-chain components induced hif-1-dependent transcription. Moreover, HIF-1 was required for the extended life spans of clk-1 and isp-1 mutants, which have reduced rates of respiration [1, 4, 13]. Inhibiting respiration appears to activate HIF-1 by elevating the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We found that ROS are increased in respiration mutants and that mild increases in ROS can stimulate HIF-1 to activate gene expression and promote longevity. In this way, HIF-1 appears to link respiratory stress in the mitochondria to a nuclear transcriptional response that promotes longevity. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Specialized oxygen-sensing cells in the nervous system generate rapid behavioural responses to oxygen. We show here that the nematode \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} exhibits a strong behavioural preference for 5-12{\%} oxygen, avoiding higher and lower oxygen levels. 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a common second messenger in sensory transduction and is implicated in oxygen sensation. Avoidance of high oxygen levels by \emph{C. elegans} requires the sensory cGMP-gated channel tax-2/tax-4 and a specific soluble guanylate cyclase homologue, gcy-35. The GCY-35 haem domain binds molecular oxygen, unlike the haem domains of classical nitric-oxide-regulated guanylate cyclases. GCY-35 and TAX-4 mediate oxygen sensation in four sensory neurons that control a naturally polymorphic social feeding behaviour in \emph{C. elegans}. Social feeding and related behaviours occur only when oxygen exceeds \emph{C. elegans}' preferred level, and require gcy-35 activity. Our results suggest that GCY-35 is regulated by molecular oxygen, and that social feeding can be a behavioural strategy for responding to hyperoxic environments.},

abstract = {Reflexes initiated by the carotid body, the principal O2-sensing organ, are critical for maintaining cardiorespiratory homeostasis during hypoxia. O2 sensing by the carotid body requires carbon monoxide (CO) generation by heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) synthesis by cystathionine-$\gamma$-lyase (CSE). We report that O2 stimulated the generation of CO, but not that of H2S, and required two cysteine residues in the heme regulatory motif (Cys(265) and Cys(282)) of HO-2. CO stimulated protein kinase G (PKG)-dependent phosphorylation of Ser(377) of CSE, inhibiting the production of H2S. Hypoxia decreased the inhibition of CSE by reducing CO generation resulting in increased H2S, which stimulated carotid body neural activity. In carotid bodies from mice lacking HO-2, compensatory increased abundance of nNOS (neuronal nitric oxide synthase) mediated O2 sensing through PKG-dependent regulation of H2S by nitric oxide. These results provide a mechanism for how three gases work in concert in the carotid body to regulate breathing.},

abstract = {Background: The nematode \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} is both sensitive and tolerant to hypoxic stress, particularly when the evolutionarily conserved hypoxia response pathway HIF-1/EGL-9/VHL is involved. Hypoxia-induced changes in the expression of a number of genes have been analyzed using whole genome microarrays in \emph{C. elegans}, but the changes at the protein level in response to hypoxic stress still remain unclear. Results: Here, we utilized a quantitative proteomic approach to evaluate changes in the expression patterns of proteins during the early response to hypoxia in \emph{C. elegans}. Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) was used to compare the proteomic maps of wild type \emph{C. elegans} strain N2 under a 4-h hypoxia treatment (0.2{\%} oxygen) and under normoxia (control). A subsequent analysis by MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS revealed nineteen protein spots that were differentially expressed. Nine of the protein spots were significantly upregulated, and ten were downregulated upon hypoxic stress. Three of the upregulated proteins were involved in cytoskeletal function (LEV-11, MLC-1, ACT-4), while another three upregulated (ATP-2, ATP-5, VHA-8) were ATP synthases functionally related to energy metabolism. Four ribosomal proteins (RPL-7, RPL-8, RPL-21, RPS-8) were downregulated, indicating a decrease in the level of protein translation upon hypoxic stress. The overexpression of tropomyosin (LEV-11) was further validated by Western blot. In addition, the mutant strain of lev-11(x12) also showed a hypoxia-sensitive phenotype in subsequent analyses, confirming the proteomic findings. Conclusions: Taken together, our data suggest that altered protein expression, structural protein remodeling, and the reduction of translation might play important roles in the early response to oxygen deprivation in \emph{C. elegans}, and this information will help broaden our knowledge on the mechanism of hypoxia response.},

Here, we report on a genetic analysis of HIF-dependent and -independent effects of VHL inactivation by studying gene expression patterns in \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans}.

abstract = {Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an endogenously produced small molecule, protects animals from various stresses. Recent studies demonstrate that animals exposed to H2S are long lived, resistant to hypoxia, and resistant to ischemia-reperfusion injury. We performed a forward genetic screen to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} uses to appropriately respond to H2S. At least two distinct pathways appear to be important for this response, including the H2S-oxidation pathway and the hydrogen cyanide (HCN)-assimilation pathway. The H2S-oxidation pathway requires two distinct enzymes important for the oxidation of H2S: the sulfide:quinone reductase sqrd-1 and the dioxygenase ethe-1. The HCN-assimilation pathway requires the cysteine synthase homologs cysl-1 and cysl-2. A low dose of either H2S or HCN can activate hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), which is required for \emph{C. elegans} to respond to either gas. sqrd-1 and cysl-2 represent the entry points in the H2S-oxidation and HCN-assimilation pathways, respectively, and expression of both of these enzymes is highly induced by HIF-1 in response to both H2S and HCN. In addition to their role in appropriately responding to H2S and HCN, we found that cysl-1 and cysl-2 are both essential mediators of innate immunity against fast paralytic killing by Pseudomonas. Furthermore, in agreement with these data, we showed that growing worms in the presence of H2S is sufficient to confer resistance to Pseudomonas fast paralytic killing. Our results suggest the hypoxia-independent hif-1 response in \emph{C. elegans} evolved to respond to the naturally occurring small molecules H2S and HCN.},

abstract = {Iron plays an essential role in many biological processes, but also catalyzes the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can cause molecular damage. Iron homeostasis is therefore a critical determinant of fitness. In \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans}, insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) promotes growth and reproduction but limits stress resistance and lifespan through inactivation of the DAF-16/FoxO transcription factor (TF). We report that long-lived daf-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutants show a daf-16-dependent increase in expression of ftn-1, which encodes the iron storage protein H-ferritin. To better understand the regulation of iron homeostasis, we performed a TF-limited genetic screen for factors influencing ftn-1 gene expression. The screen identified the heat-shock TF hsf-1, the MAD bHLH TF mdl-1, and the putative histone acetyl transferase ada-2 as activators of ftn-1 expression. It also revealed that the HIF$\alpha$ homolog hif-1 and its binding partner aha-1 (HIF$\beta$) are potent repressors of ftn-1 expression. ftn-1 expression is induced by exposure to iron, and we found that hif-1 was required for this induction. In addition, we found that the prolyl hydroxylase EGL-9, which represses HIF-1 via the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor VHL-1, can also act antagonistically to VHL-1 in regulating ftn-1. This suggests a novel mechanism for HIF target gene regulation by these evolutionarily conserved and clinically important hydroxylases. Our findings imply that the IIS and HIF pathways act together to regulate iron homeostasis in \emph{C. elegans}. We suggest that IIS/DAF-16 regulation of ftn-1 modulates a trade-off between growth and stress resistance, as elevated iron availability supports growth but also increases ROS production.},

abstract = {Oxygen influences behaviour in many organisms, with low levels (hypoxia) having devastating consequences for neuron survival. How neurons respond physiologically to counter the effects of hypoxia is not fully understood. Here, we show that hypoxia regulates the trafficking of the glutamate receptor GLR-1 in \emph{C. elegans} neurons. Either hypoxia or mutations in egl-9, a prolyl hydroxylase cellular oxygen sensor, result in the internalization of GLR-1, the reduction of glutamate-activated currents, and the depression of GLR-1-mediated behaviours. Surprisingly, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, the canonical substrate of EGL-9, is not required for this effect. Instead, EGL-9 interacts with the Mint orthologue LIN-10, a mediator of GLR-1 membrane recycling, to promote LIN-10 subcellular localization in an oxygen-dependent manner. The observed effects of hypoxia and egl-9 mutations require the activity of the proline-directed CDK-5 kinase and the CDK-5 phosphorylation sites on LIN-10, suggesting that EGL-9 and CDK-5 compete in an oxygen-dependent manner to regulate LIN-10 activity and thus GLR-1 trafficking. Our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which neurons sense and respond to hypoxia.},

Activation of hif-1 by hypoxia or by mutations in its negative regulator egl-9/prolyl hydroxylase shifts behavioral oxygen preferences to lower concentrations and eliminates a regulatory input from food. At a neuronal level, hif-1 activation transforms a distributed, regulated neuronal network for oxygen preference into a smaller, fixed network that is constitutively active. The hif-1 pathway acts both in neurons and in gonadal endocrine cells to regulate oxygen preference.

In nature, low oxygen environments are often found to contain high levels of hydrogen sulfide (H2 S). Here, we show that \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} can have mutually exclusive responses to H2 S and hypoxia, both involving HIF-1. Specifically, H2 S results in HIF-1 activity throughout the hypodermis, whereas hypoxia causes HIF-1 activity in the gut as judged by a reporter for HIF-1 activity. \emph{C. elegans} require hif-1 to survive in room air containing trace amounts of H2 S. Exposure to H2 S results in HIF-1 nuclear localization and transcription of HIF-1 targets. The effects of H2 S on HIF-1 reporter activity are independent of von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL)-1, whereas VHL-1 is required for hypoxic regulation of HIF-1 reporter activity. Because H2 S is naturally produced by animal cells, our results suggest that endogenous H2 S may influence HIF-1 activity.},

abstract = {Many genes are responsible for the modulation of lifespan in model organisms. In addition to regulating adaptive biologic responses that control stress signaling and longevity, some of these genes participate in tumor formation. The mechanisms that determine longevity and link regulation of lifespan with tumorigenesis are poorly understood. Here, we show that the tumor suppressor von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), which has widely known roles in renal carcinogenesis and the formation of kidney cysts, controls longevity in \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans}. Loss of vhl-1 significantly increased lifespan and resulted in accelerated basal signaling of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase PMK-3. Furthermore, the VHL-1 effect on the regulation of lifespan was independent of the insulin/IGF-1-like signaling pathway, suggesting a mechanism for stress resistance that controls both lifespan and tumorigenesis. These findings define VHL-1 as a player in longevity signaling and connect aging, regulation of lifespan, and stress responses with formation of renal cell carcinomas.},

abstract = {Dietary restriction (DR) extends lifespan in various species and also slows the onset of age-related diseases. Previous studies from flies and yeast have demonstrated that the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway is essential for longevity phenotypes resulting from DR. TOR is a conserved protein kinase that regulates growth and metabolism in response to nutrients and growth factors. While some of the downstream targets of TOR have been implicated in regulating lifespan, it is still unclear whether additional targets of this pathway also modulate lifespan. It has been shown that the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is one of the targets of the TOR pathway in mammalian cells. HIF-1 is a transcription factor complex that plays key roles in oxygen homeostasis, tumor formation, glucose metabolism, cell survival, and inflammatory response. Here, we describe a novel role for HIF-1 in modulating lifespan extension by DR in \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans}. We find that HIF-1 deficiency results in extended lifespan, which overlaps with that by inhibition of the RSKS-1/S6 kinase, a key component of the TOR pathway. Using a modified DR method based on variation of bacterial food concentrations on solid agar plates, we find that HIF-1 modulates longevity in a nutrient-dependent manner. The hif-1 loss-of-function mutant extends lifespan under rich nutrient conditions but fails to show lifespan extension under DR. Conversely, a mutation in egl-9, which increases HIF-1 activity, diminishes the lifespan extension under DR. This deficiency is rescued by tissue-specific expression of egl-9 in specific neurons and muscles. Increased lifespan by hif-1 or DR is dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulator inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE-1) and is associated with lower levels of ER stress. Therefore, our results demonstrate a tissue-specific role for HIF-1 in the lifespan extension by DR involving the IRE-1 ER stress pathway.},

abstract = {Many aerobic organisms encounter oxygen-deprived environments and thus must have adaptive mechanisms to survive such stress. It is important to understand how mitochondria respond to oxygen deprivation given the critical role they play in using oxygen to generate cellular energy. Here we examine mitochondrial stress response in \emph{C. elegans}, which adapt to extreme oxygen deprivation (anoxia, less than 0.1{\%} oxygen) by entering into a reversible suspended animation state of locomotory arrest. We show that neuronal mitochondria undergo DRP-1-dependent fission in response to anoxia and undergo refusion upon reoxygenation. The hypoxia response pathway, including EGL-9 and HIF-1, is not required for anoxia-induced fission, but does regulate mitochondrial reconstitution during reoxygenation. Mutants for egl-9 exhibit a rapid refusion of mitochondria and a rapid behavioral recovery from suspended animation during reoxygenation; both phenotypes require HIF-1. Mitochondria are significantly larger in egl-9 mutants after reoxygenation, a phenotype similar to stress-induced mitochondria hyperfusion (SIMH). Anoxia results in mitochondrial oxidative stress, and the oxidative response factor SKN-1/Nrf is required for both rapid mitochondrial refusion and rapid behavioral recovery during reoxygenation. In response to anoxia, SKN-1 promotes the expression of the mitochondrial resident protein Stomatin-like 1 (STL-1), which helps facilitate mitochondrial dynamics following anoxia. Our results suggest the existence of a conserved anoxic stress response involving changes in mitochondrial fission and fusion.},

abstract = {Oxygen is critically important to metazoan life, and the EGL-9/PHD enzymes are key regulators of hypoxia (low oxygen) response. When oxygen levels are high, the EGL-9/PHD proteins hydroxylate hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factors. Once hydroxylated, HIFalpha subunits bind to von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligases and are degraded. Prior genetic analyses in \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} had shown that EGL-9 also acted through a vhl-1-independent pathway to inhibit HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Here, we characterize this novel EGL-9 function. We employ an array of complementary methods to inhibit EGL-9 hydroxylase activity in vivo. These include hypoxia, hydroxylase inhibitors, mutation of the proline in HIF-1 that is normally modified by EGL-9, and mutation of the EGL-9 catalytic core. Remarkably, we find that each of these treatments or mutations eliminates oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF-1 protein, but none of them abolishes EGL-9-mediated repression of HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Further, analyses of new egl-9 alleles reveal that the evolutionarily conserved EGL-9 MYND zinc finger domain does not have a major role in HIF-1 regulation. We conclude that \emph{C. elegans} EGL-9 is a bifunctional protein. In addition to its well-established role as the oxygen sensor that regulates HIF-1 protein levels, EGL-9 inhibits HIF-1 transcriptional activity via a pathway that has little or no requirement for hydroxylase activity or for the EGL-9 MYND domain.},

From a genetic screen, we found that the cytochrome P450 oxygenase CYP-13A12 acts in response to the EGL-9-HIF-1 pathway to facilitate the O2-ON response. CYP-13A12 promotes oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into eicosanoids, signaling molecules that can strongly affect inflammatory pain and ischemia-reperfusion injury responses in mammals.

abstract = {Understanding host defense against microbes is key to developing new and more effective therapies for infection and inflammatory disease. However, how animals integrate multiple environmental signals and discriminate between different pathogens to mount specific and tailored responses remains poorly understood. Using the genetically tractable model host \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} and pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, we describe an important role for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) in defining the specificity of the host response in the intestine. We demonstrate that loss of egl-9, a negative regulator of HIF, confers HIF-dependent enhanced susceptibility to S. aureus while increasing resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In our attempt to understand how HIF could have these apparently dichotomous roles in host defense, we find that distinct pathways separately regulate two opposing functions of HIF: the canonical pathway is important for blocking expression of a set of HIF-induced defense genes, whereas a less well understood noncanonical pathway appears to be important for allowing the expression of another distinct set of HIF-repressed defense genes. Thus, HIF can function either as a gene-specific inducer or repressor of host defense, providing a molecular mechanism by which HIF can have apparently opposing roles in defense and inflammation. Together, our observations show that HIF can set the balance between alternative pathogen-specific host responses, potentially acting as an evolutionarily conserved specificity switch in the host innate immune response.},

The stability of the \emph{C. elegans} HIF-1 protein is controlled by the evolutionarily conserved EGL-9/VHL-1 pathway for oxygen-dependent degradation. Here, we describe vhl-1-independent pathways that attenuate HIF-1 transcriptional activity in \emph{C. elegans}. First, the expression of HIF-1 target genes is markedly higher in egl-9 mutants than in vhl-1 mutants. We show that HIF-1 protein levels are similar in animals carrying strong loss-of-function mutations in either egl-9 or vhl-1. We conclude that EGL-9 inhibits HIF-1 activity, as well as HIF-1 stability. Second, we identify the rhy-1 gene and show that it acts in a novel negative feedback loop to inhibit expression of HIF-1 target genes. rhy-1 encodes a multi-pass transmembrane protein. Although loss-of-function mutations in rhy-1 cause relatively modest increases in hif-1 mRNA and HIF-1 protein expression, some HIF-1 target genes are expressed at higher levels in rhy-1 mutants than in vhl-1 mutants. Animals lacking both vhl-1 and rhy-1 function have a more severe phenotype than either single mutant. Collectively, these data support models in which RHY-1 and EGL-9 function in VHL-1-independent pathway(s) to repress HIF-1 transcriptional activity.},

abstract = {The \emph{C. elegans} HIF-1 proline hydroxylase EGL-9 functions as an O 2 sensor in an evolutionarily conserved pathway for adaptation to hypoxia. H 2S accumulates during hypoxia and promotes HIF-1 activity, but how H 2S signals are perceived and transmitted to modulate HIF-1 and animal behavior is unknown. We report that the experience of hypoxia modifies a \emph{C. elegans} locomotive behavioral response to O 2 through the EGL-9 pathway. From genetic screens to identify novel regulators of EGL-9-mediated behavioral plasticity, we isolated mutations of the gene cysl-1, which encodes a \emph{C. elegans} homolog of sulfhydrylases/cysteine synthases. Hypoxia-dependent behavioral modulation and H 2S-induced HIF-1 activation require the direct physical interaction of CYSL-1 with the EGL-9 C terminus. Sequestration of EGL-9 by CYSL-1 and inhibition of EGL-9-mediated hydroxylation by hypoxia together promote neuronal HIF-1 activation to modulate behavior. These findings demonstrate that CYSL-1 acts to transduce signals from H 2S to EGL-9 to regulate O 2-dependent behavioral plasticity in \emph{C. elegans}. Ma et al. find that the \emph{C. elegans} protein CYSL-1, similar to bacterial thiol metabolic enzymes, binds to and inhibits the O 2-sensing hydroxylase EGL-9. This interaction transduces signals from H 2S to regulate O 2-dependent behavioral plasticity. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Because of the large number of genes and the complexity of biological networks, clustering is a useful exploratory technique for analysis of gene expression data. Other classical techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), have also been applied to analyze gene expression data. Using different data analysis techniques and different clustering algorithms to analyze the same data set can lead to very different conclusions. Our goal is to study the effectiveness of principal components (PCs) in capturing cluster structure. Specifically, using both real and synthetic gene expression data sets, we compared the quality of clusters obtained from the original data to the quality of clusters obtained after projecting onto subsets of the principal component axes. RESULTS: Our empirical study showed that clustering with the PCs instead of the original variables does not necessarily improve, and often degrades, cluster quality. In particular, the first few PCs (which contain most of the variation in the data) do not necessarily capture most of the cluster structure. We also showed that clustering with PCs has different impact on different algorithms and different similarity metrics. Overall, we would not recommend PCA before clustering except in special circumstances.},

Here, we present the WormBase Enrichment Suite, which offers users the ability to test all nematode ontologies simultaneously. We show that the WormBase Enrichment Suite provides valuable insight into different biological problems. Briefly, we show that phenotype enrichment analysis (PEA) can help researchers identify disease phenologs, phenotypes that are homologous across species, which can inform disease modeling in C. elegans. The WormBase Enrichment Suite analysis can also shed light on RNA-seq datasets by showing what molecular functions are enriched, which phenotypes these functions are implicated in and what tissues are overrepresented in the dataset. Finally, we explore the phenotype-anatomy relationship, showing that a small subset of highly specific tissues are disproportionately likely to cause an Egl phenotype, but inferring tissue expression from an Egl phenotype is limited to the largest tissues.},

abstract = {Understanding genome and gene function in a whole organism requires us to fully understand the life cycle and the physiology of the organism in question. Although it is traditionally though of as a hermaphrodite, C. elegans XX animals become (endogenous) females after 3 days of egg-laying. The molecular physiology of this state has not been studied as intensely as other parts of the life cycle, in spite of documented changes in behavior and metabolism that occur at this stage. To study the female state of C. elegans, we designed an experiment to measure the transcriptome of 1st day adult females, endogenous, 6th day adult females, as well as mutant feminized worms that never go through a hermaphrodite stage at these time points. Using this experimental design, we were able to measure the effects of biological aging from the transition into the female state. We find that spermless young adult animals partially phenocopy 6 day old wild-type animals that have depleted their sperm after egg-laying, and that spermless animals also exhibit less transcriptomic changes associated with aging throughout these 6 days. Our results indicate that sperm loss triggers naturally ocurring transcriptomic changes},
