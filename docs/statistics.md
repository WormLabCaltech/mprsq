Welcome to the statistical methods section of this website. We have generated
a very brief set of tutorials for the statistical methods that we used for our
paper. Hopefully this will make the article more accessible and be helpful to
anyone who needs to replicate partially or completely some of the code we used.

# Kallisto, read pseudo-alignment

# Sleuth, differential expression analysis

# Bayesian robust regressions
