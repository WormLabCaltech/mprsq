## Basic statistics
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/analysis_notebooks/1_basic_stats.html"> Jupyter Notebook</a>

## Predicting interactions between genes
We used correlational analyses to predict genetic interactions.

## Transcriptome-wide epistasis analysis
Development of the formalism for, and measurement of, transcriptome-wide epistasis.

## Decorrelation within a pathway
Transcriptome weighted correlations between mutants decrease in magnitude the
farther apart two genes are from each other.

## Non-canonical epistasis
Transcriptomes provide an unbiased view of genetic relationships, which can be used
to identify epistasis relationships that are different from what is usually reported.

## Enrichment analysis of the hypoxia pathway
We use the WormBase Enrichment Suite to understand the biological functions that
the hypoxia pathway is activating in *C. elegans*.

## Finding *hif-1*-independent responses
Our experimental design allows us to identify genes whose expression is
*hif-1*-independent yet dependent on other genes. In other words, we identify
branches in the pathway.

## Quality Check
There are known genes that have *hif-1*-dependent expression. Here, we check that
these genes behave as expected from the literature.

## Transcription Factors in the Hypoxia Pathway
A short overview of what transcription factors are activated when HIF-1 accumulates
in *C. elegans*.
