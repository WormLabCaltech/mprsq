Hi, welcome to the main website for our project [*'Genetic Reconstruction of a Complete Pathway in a Metazoan'*](). This website contains interactive plots of the analysis, and also contains an HTML version of the iPython Notebook for our analysis. [Here]() is the repository where all of the data is contained.

<!-- TODO: Add link to draft -->
Moreover, an open-access version of our paper can be found [here]().

This website constitutes 100% of the Supplementary Material and Extended Results for our paper.
