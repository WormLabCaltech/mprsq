Hi, welcome to the main website for our project ['*Reconstructing a metazoan genetic pathway with transcriptome-wide epistasis measurements*'](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/18/112920). This website contains interactive plots of the analysis, and also contains an HTML version of the iPython Notebook for our analysis. [Here](https://github.com/WormLabCaltech/mprsq) is the repository where all of the data is contained.

This website constitutes 100% of the Supplementary Material and Extended Results for our paper.
